  <strong>Travel Information</strong>   <p></p>
Due to roads, weather, tide, airline schedules and outside forces that we are unable to control clients should be prepared for changes on the go by your tour leader and/or tour director because of weather, tides, and weather predictions sometimes days away. Itineraries are intended as examples only. Clients must be prepared to be flexible; schedules may vary depending on conditions at the time or predicted by weather and marine basin forecasts. While we make every attempt to perform each tour on our itinerary we are not responsible if cancellations are necessary. We reserve the right to decline or accept any person as a member of the tour and failure to comply with rules and trip safety considerations may cause KNG Travel to extricate any client who fails to show due diligence or conform to the spirit of the tour in progress. Additional expenses, if any, shall be borne by the participant(s).

<strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>  <p></p>
All tour payments are non refundable. If you are unable to attend your expedition date, at our discretion we can transfer your credit to another tour of equal or similar value if another tour is available in that calendar year.

<strong>Insurance</strong>  <p></p>
We strongly recommend trip cancellation/medical evacuation insurance. Because many advance logistical arrangements have been made prior to the operation of these trips, we must adhere to the above cancellation policy. In addition, you should be aware that some medical insurance policies do not cover your expenses, including medical evacuation, while traveling in a foreign country. KNG Travel will not be held responsible for missed connections, incorrect check in times, improper documentation, lost, stolen or damaged luggage. Any additional expenses caused by late or cancelled transportation carriers will be borne by the traveller.
